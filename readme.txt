= Can I add my own fun facts? =
There is an easy interface built in the plugin to add your own fun facts. Go to Settings > Fun Facts to do that. Add one fun fact per line without any HTML code.

= Is the plugin compatible with versions of WordPress ealier to 2.8? =
No. Because of the new widget implementation, you need to use WordPress 2.8 or later. If you are using an earlier version of WordPress, you can try using Fun Facts version 1.0 but, really, you should upgrade.
